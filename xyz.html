            <p>In many countries, a certificate is a qualification attained in secondary education. For instance,
               students in the Republic of Ireland sit the Junior Certificate and follow it with the Leaving
               Certificate. Similarly, other countries have awards, for instance, in Australia the Higher School
               Certificate (HSC) in New South Wales, the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) in Victoria, etc., is
               the examination taken on completion of secondary education. In parts of the United Kingdom the General
               Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) is the normal examination taken at age 16 and the General
               Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced Subsidiary Level (AS-level) and Advanced Level (A-levels) are
               taken at 17 and 18.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
               In many other countries, certificates are qualifications in higher education. For example the National
               Certificate in the Republic of Ireland, which was replaced in 2006 by the "Higher Certificate". These
               have the titles Certificate (at an undergraduate level), Graduate Certificate (at an undergraduate level,
               but requiring the completion of a prior undergraduate degree for admission), and Postgraduate Certificate
               (at a postgraduate level). In Hong Kong, students take the exams to receive Hong Kong Diploma of
               Secondary Education. Certificate is below the standard of the associate degree, diploma, higher diploma
               and advanced diploma, which are below the bachelor's degree. Postgraduate certificates are taken after
               the bachelor's degree and are sometimes more vocationally oriented than master's degrees.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
               In Australia, a certificate is a qualification offered by a university or other higher education provider
               which is shorter than a degree or diploma. Certificates are generally provided by TAFE colleges or
               non-academic registered training organizations (often workplaces). There are four ranks of certificate in
               Australia, indicated by Roman numerals, e.g., Cert. IV in Horticulture. The time spent varies, but in
               general a Certificate I will be granted after a course of only a few weeks, while a Cert. IV may take up
               to twelve months. A Diploma directly follows Cert. IV and may rightly be considered equivalent to a
               hypothetical Certificate V.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
               It also may be awarded as a necessary certification to validate that a student is considered competent in
               a certain specific networking skill area in information technology. Thus a computer engineer or computer
               science graduation most likely will have to obtain additional certificates on and pertaining to the
               specific technologies or equipment used by the hiring corporation; if not, such employer may suffer
               unwanted penalties like forgoing (voiding the contract) the protections of a certain level of customer
               service or warranties.
